Password Generator: 
    I created a password genertaor that lets users decide which type of characters they wpuld like to complete within their random generated passwords. Through prompts i gave the user the ability to decide and the program excludes options that were not decided upon. The user was also given the option to decide the amount of characters desired to determine the length of the password with 8-128 characters.
